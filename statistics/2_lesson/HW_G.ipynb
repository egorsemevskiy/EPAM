    "The example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume, we need to estimate a mean votes count for every election candidate. Suppose there are 3 cities in a country: 1 million factory workers live in city A, 2 million office workers live in city B, and 3 million senior citizens live in city B. We can choose a random sample of 60 votes from the entire population, but there is some chance that the random sample will be poorly balanced between these cities and, therefore, will be biased and of little use (\"average temperature in the hospital\"), causing a significant error in the estimation. Instead, if we choose to use a simple random sample of 10, 20 and 30 votes from cities A, B and C, respectively, we can get a smaller error in the estimate with the same total sample size. This technique is called stratification.\n",
    "\n",

    "Suppose the population is a mixture of 3 normally distributed CBs. In other words, the population can be divided into 3 strata.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Derive (for example, in the block below, using Markdown) the formulas for point estimates of the mathematical expectation and variance for the average value of subsamples formed in different ways:\n",
    "- random selection from the entire population;\n",
    "- random selection of strata in proportion to shares;\n",
    "- random selection according to the optimal sub-sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate point estimates of the mathematical expectation and variance for the average value for each data sampling method from p.1, provided:\n",
    "* Experiments should be conducted for 3 cases (for every method from p.1 each):\n",
    "     * all strata have the same mat. expectations and variance;\n",
    "     * strata have different mat. expectations, but the same variance;\n",
    "     * strata have different mat. expectations and variance.\n",
    "* Repeat this for these sample sizes: 40 and 500;\n",
    "* Also a single experiment is repeated 1000 times;\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, total number of experiments will be equal to 18 (3 methods of sampling \\* 3 cases of distribution parameters \\* 2 sample sizes).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: you conduct an experiment for random sample method with equal ME and variance of stata. For each strata you sample the data with size equal to 40 and estimate the statistics 1000 times. Thus, now you can average the results or plot boxplots (we suggest you do this) to compare the point estimations for each strata. Then you repeat this for sample size equal to 500. And then you can conduct the same pipeline for different sampling methods.  \n",
